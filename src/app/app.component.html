            <h5>What is Quarkus?</h5>
            <p>Quarkus was created to enable Java developers to create applications for a modern, cloud-native world.
              Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java framework tailored for GraalVM and HotSpot, crafted from best-of-breed
              Java libraries and standards. The goal is to make Java the leading platform in Kubernetes and serverless
              environments while offering developers a framework to address a wider range of distributed application
              architectures.</p><hr>
            <h5>What is Angular?</h5>
            <p>Angular is a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
              <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing,
                forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
              <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
            </ul>
